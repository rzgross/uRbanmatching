\usage{
gen_propensity_list(
  propensity_function = propensity_score_xgb(),
  oos_propensity = FALSE,
  n_folds = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{propensity_function}{A function that accepts a list
with four elements: \code{x_train}, \code{x_test},
\code{y_train}, \code{y_test}, and forms predictions
using \code{x_test} (I guess \code{y_test} isn't used yet)}

\item{oos_propensity}{Logical, do you want to predict out of sample
for the propensity score? Most people don't, and indeed \code{FALSE}
is the default.}

\item{n_folds}{Default NULL; how many folds you want if using
out of sample propensity.}
}
\value{
Named list, same names as input params.
